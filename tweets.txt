Every woman—regardless of income or zip code—deserves access to health care. If you don't get that, you have no business being president.
Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care.
Remember: If you make abortion a crime, you make women who seek abortions criminals. You put one in three women at risk.
The fact is, Trump isn't that different from every other Republican candidate who would also outlaw abortion.
Even by his impossibly low standards, @realDonaldTrump's suggestion that women be punished for seeking abortion is abhorrent.

We need real plans to combat systemic racism and remove the barriers holding African Americans back. Hillary's plan: https://t.co/8EsDQhjJgU
"When we come together—all of us—with a sense of shared purpose and shared humanity, we can solve any problem and heal any divide." —Hillary
"We need to recognize our privilege and practice humility, rather than assume that our experiences are everyone’s experiences." —Hillary
"White Americans need to do a better job of listening when African Americans talk about the seen &amp; unseen barriers that you face every day."
"Ending systemic racism requires contributions from all of us—especially those of us who haven’t experienced it ourselves." —Hillary
"Let's roll up our sleeves and get to work dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline...We need a cradle-to-college pipeline." —Hillary
"We need to fix the crisis of mass incarceration...and end the epidemic of African Americans being killed by police or dying in custody."
"We need end-to-end reform in our criminal justice system—not half-measures, but a full commitment with real follow-through." —Hillary
"I’ll be the first to admit...I’ve made my own mistakes; I've walked my own journey. But I believe with all my heart that we can do better."
Anyone asking for your vote has a responsibility to grapple with reality—to see things as they actually are, not just as we want them to be.
"These are not only problems of economic inequality. They are problems of racial inequality. We’ve got to say that loudly and clearly."
"These inequities are wrong, but they’re also immoral. ... We have to begin by facing up to the reality of systemic racism." —Hillary
"Something’s wrong when black kids get arrested for petty crimes but white CEOs get away with fleecing our entire country." —Hillary
"We face a complex set of economic, social, and political challenges. They’re intersectional, reinforcing, &amp; we’ve got to take them all on."
It’s not a coincidence that the Flint water crisis was allowed to happen in a largely black, largely poor community.
"I want to talk about how we break down barriers that disproportionately affect African Americans, &amp; build ladders of opportunity." —Hillary
Watch live—Hillary speaks about how we can combat systemic racism and break down barriers for black families: https://t.co/ouhkrXRaTS

Everyone has his or her own journey to the ballot box. Here are stories behind the votes. https://t.co/lIiKjUxSqz https://t.co/E6J0rXQ4e9
.@POTUS is doing his job by nominating a new Supreme Court justice. Tell Senate Republicans to do theirs: https://t.co/kkBRBgjBbu
It's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices, and the Senate has a responsibility to vote. https://t.co/kPHBb4yEqA
11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job. Do yours. -H
10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too—and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H
9 There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee. -H
8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn’t righteous, it's disgraceful. -H
7 With these critical cases in the balance, Republicans wasted no time in vowing to block any SCOTUS nomination from @POTUS. A new low. -H
6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock. -H
5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H
4 Right now, the fundamental principle of "one person, one vote” is at stake in a case before the Supreme Court. -H
3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H
2 The need to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is not an occasion for politics as usual. This has real and urgent stakes for Americans now. -H
1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices—it's right there in the Constitution. -H https://t.co/AWV47TRaTw

We cannot accept 33,000 gun deaths per year as “normal.” Most Americans—including law-abiding gun owners—believe we can and must do better.

There have been approximately 2,800 gun deaths since the last #DemDebate one month ago. We can't wait any longer to act on gun violence.

Hillary will fight to protect DACA/DAPA, pass comprehensive immigration reform, and keep families together. #DemDebate
Hillary will defend President Obama’s executive actions on immigration—and if Congress refuses to act, do everything possible to go further.
There is no place in America for second-class citizenship. Hard-working immigrant families deserve a path to full and equal citizenship.

https://t.co/ov0lBwpS4W
We should build on the progress we've made on health care—not go back to square one. #DemDebate https://t.co/24rXGZDReo
We should make the tax system fairer: close loopholes for Wall Street money managers and millionaires and give the middle class a tax break.
A higher minimum wage will help close the pay gap, help lift millions of women out of poverty, and have a ripple effect across our economy.

To truly honor those lost at Benghazi, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the brave Americans who do their work.
America must do all we can to protect our personnel doing the important work of representing our interests and values around the world.
The work of Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of this approach to foreign policy.
America must pursue a smart brand of leadership that integrates and balances the tools of diplomacy, development, and defense.
We cannot return to the go-it-alone foreign policy of the past, where military-based solutions are pursued as a first option.
American diplomats cannot conduct their work from bunkers. Advancing US interests often means going to unstable regions.
Hillary is testifying before @HouseBenghazi to defend the vision of US diplomacy that Ambassador Stevens gave his life carrying out.
America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from the Benghazi tragedy.
A lesson from Benghazi: Congress needs to do its part to ensure that our diplomats in dangerous parts of the world are as safe as possible.

That's just a "single issue" where @HillaryClinton and I differ.
In my view, we need to repeal the 1996 welfare reform provisions and expand, not weaken, the social safety net.
In 2008, @HillaryClinton said that “welfare should not be an anti-poverty program.” I disagree.
This legislation has weakened the social safety net and increased extreme poverty. That is unacceptable.
This legislation gave Republican governors like Scott Walker the responsibility to provide a safety net for families in need.
In 1994, welfare provided a vital safety net to more than 14 million Americans. Today, it only helps 4.4 million.
Families LIVING IN POVERTY receiving cash benefits:
1996: 68%
2014: Only 23%
From 1996 to 2011, households living in EXTREME poverty increased 182% for African Americans; 132% for Hispanics; 109% for White Americans.
The number of children in extreme poverty has skyrocketed from 1.4 million to 3.5 million.
It established strict work requirements for receiving benefits and severely limited access to benefits for undocumented people.
Since this legislation was signed into law, families living in extreme poverty have more than doubled from 636,000 to 1.65 million.
It turns out that the welfare reform bill has been an absolute disaster.
Unfortunately, @HillaryClinton supported this bill calling it “a critical first step to reforming our nation’s welfare system.”
I called that bill “an assault on the poor, women and children, minorities, and immigrants.” I believed that then and I believe that now.
One of the biggest differences between the Clintons and myself in this campaign is our view on welfare reform.

In a democratic society, politics should not be treated like a baseball game or a soap opera. We need discussion about serious issues.
Together, we can move to a foreign policy rooted in sound judgment that will move us away from perpetual warfare.
Americans need a president who will think about their future 10, 15, 20 years down the line — someone with judgment.
Unfortunately, what I predicted at the time about the destabilization of the region came true.
In 2003, I voted against the War in Iraq. It was a hard vote to cast when so many were calling for war.
That starts with defending veterans’ benefits from attempts to cut them in our Congress.
In the wake of that war, we must never forget the incredible sacrifices made by our veterans.
That’s money that could have been spent on rebuilding America’s schools, roads, bridges and water systems.
When the last benefits are calculated, that war will have cost the United States taxpayers several trillion dollars.
We invaded Iraq 13 years ago today. We must ask ourselves: are we more or less safe because of that war?

I want to thank the people of Nevada for the support they have given us and the boost that their support will give us as we go forward.

It is absurd that one family (the Waltons of @Walmart) has more wealth than the bottom 130 million Americans.

Thank you New Hampshire for tonight’s result, which has left the Washington Cartel utterly terrified.
Because of tonight, the voters will have a clear choice. We are here because of you. Because of your passion for our nation.
The real winner is the grassroots who propelled us to a victory in Iowa and a far stronger outcome in New Hampshire than anyone predicted.
Together, we've done what the pundits &amp; the media said couldn't be done, what the DC establishment desperately hoped wouldn’t be done.
